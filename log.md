# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

Day 1: September 12, 2020

Started to build my version of Conway's Game of Life. The thought process is to first create a 100 * 100 grid. Used matplotlib for the first time today. Wasn't able to do it or other related things like make ticks and labels invisible. Frustrating, but it's only the first day, hopefully it'll get better from here.
Also did some basic CSS from FreeCodeCamp, was my first experience with CSS. Felt better having done something concrete after the frustration earlier in the day.
