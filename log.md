Day 1: September 12, 2020

Started to build my version of Conway's Game of Life. The thought process is to first create a 100 * 100 grid. Used matplotlib for the first time today. Wasn't able to do it or other related things like make ticks and labels invisible. Frustrating, but it's only the first day, hopefully it'll get better from here.
Also did some basic CSS from FreeCodeCamp, was my first experience with CSS. Felt better having done something concrete after the frustration earlier in the day.

Day 2: September 13, 2020

Made good progress today. Used numpy for the first time. Used it for data entry, and plotted it through matplotlib. Felt great after yesterday's disappointing start to the challenge.

Day 3: September 14, 2020

Tried animating the plot. No luck. Seems that my code progresses on alternate days. Hope tomorrow will be good again.

Day 4: September 15, 2020

Started the day trying to animate the plot. Not only did I fail to do that, I realised that the one part of my code that was correct was wrong as well. Turned out that fixing that very segment of code allowed me to animate the plot, alongwith the piece of code I thought was responsible for screwing up the animation. Despair at failing on successive days was turned into sheer joy when I saw the output I wanted. Hope tomorrow is also productive and not a bad day like the other odd days of the challenge.

Day 5: September 16, 2020

Increased the size of the plot to 51 * 51. Added a piece of code for edges and corners, then removed it later as it was redundant. Fixed animation slowdown in later frames. Started writing first DEV post.

Day 6: September 17, 2020

The block I thought was redundant was not redundant after all. Went back to older commit, had some problems merging it back, but eventually managed. Still not ideal behaviour around the edges, but cells can reach there now.

Day 7: September 18, 2020

Added 2 new files.  `in_state.py` takes in input in a user friendly manner, `grid.py` creates a grid using the input, and `game.py` animates the plot. Input can be given in a much simpler manner now instead of writing `grid[x,y]=1` each time. Very happy with the day's work.

Day 8: September 19, 2020

Pausing the project for a while to focus on Hacktoberfest. Completed the basic CSS course from FreeCodeCamp.
