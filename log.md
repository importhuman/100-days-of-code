Day 1: September 12, 2020

Started to build my version of Conway's Game of Life. The thought process is to first create a 100 * 100 grid. Used matplotlib for the first time today. Wasn't able to do it or other related things like make ticks and labels invisible. Frustrating, but it's only the first day, hopefully it'll get better from here.
Also did some basic CSS from FreeCodeCamp, was my first experience with CSS. Felt better having done something concrete after the frustration earlier in the day.

Day 2: September 13, 2020

Made good progress today. Used numpy for the first time. Used it for data entry, and plotted it through matplotlib. Felt great after yesterday's disappointing start to the challenge.

Day 3: September 14, 2020

Tried animating the plot. No luck. Seems that my code progresses on alternate days. Hope tomorrow will be good again.

Day 4: September 15, 2020

Started the day trying to animate the plot. Not only did I fail to do that, I realised that the one part of my code that was correct was wrong as well. Turned out that fixing that very segment of code allowed me to animate the plot, alongwith the piece of code I thought was responsible for screwing up the animation. Despair at failing on successive days was turned into sheer joy when I saw the output I wanted. Hope tomorrow is also productive and not a bad day like the other odd days of the challenge.

Day 5: September 16, 2020

Increased the size of the plot to 51 * 51. Added a piece of code for edges and corners, then removed it later as it was redundant. Fixed animation slowdown in later frames. Started writing first DEV post.

Day 6: September 17, 2020

The block I thought was redundant was not redundant after all. Went back to older commit, had some problems merging it back, but eventually managed. Still not ideal behaviour around the edges, but cells can reach there now.

Day 7: September 18, 2020

Added 2 new files.  `in_state.py` takes in input in a user friendly manner, `grid.py` creates a grid using the input, and `game.py` animates the plot. Input can be given in a much simpler manner now instead of writing `grid[x,y]=1` each time. Very happy with the day's work.

Day 8: September 19, 2020

Pausing the project for a while to focus on Hacktoberfest. Completed the basic CSS course from FreeCodeCamp.

Day 9: September 20, 2020

Not much, searched for projects for Hacktober.

Day 10: September 21, 2020

Ciphey looks interesting. Expressed interest in an issue.

Day 11: September 22, 2020

The issue I was interested in also requires C++, so I'll have to look for another one. Started learning applied visual design via FreeCodeCamp.

Day 12: September 23, 2020

Did some more applied visual design. Realised that I'm learning quite a lot of things that I'm unlikely to use by myself very soon, which will lead to a lot of forgetting so I'll try to make some notes about what I've learned so far.

Day 13: September 24, 2020

Made notes about the new HTML stuff I learned recently. Took longer than expected, but happy I did it. Also registered for hacktoberfest.

Day 14: September 25, 2020

Started contributing to open source. It's a resume building application. Had signed up for a different issue, but ended up doing some documentation work instead. Couldn't get the application to run today, hopefully tomorrow will be better.

Day 15: September 26, 2020

A bunch of stuff today, but not too productive overall. Learnt a bit about frameworks, decorators, and  Flask. Need to work on my ability to read documentation, get tired way too easily.

Day 16: September 27, 2020

Read through the code for my GitHub issue, tried a solution, didn't work. Frustrating day overall.

*Took a break on September 28, 2020*

Day 17: September 29, 2020

Found the solution to my issue thanks to StackOverflow. Made some CSS notes. Really boring work. Do it simultaneously while learning from now on.

Day 18: September 30, 2020

Tried looking for Hacktoberfest issues, no luck.

Day 19: October 1, 2020

Nice day overall, quite a lot of stuff today. Made a PR, then found a Pokémon based repo which is very interesting to me and I've already made a PR, will work further on it. Also learnt a bit about tig and venv. 

Day 20: October 2, 2020

Some more work on the Pokémon project. Work seems easier when it's for a project you're interested in.

Day 21: October 3, 2020

Continued work on the same project. So far, I've basically only done data entry (without a database, that is), will read and try to understand the codebase over the next few days so I can contribute better. 

Day 22: October 4, 2020

Started going through the project code. Learnt a bit about the random module, floor function, args, kwargs. Also found out this repository doesn't count towards Hacktoberfest. Have requested the owner to add the topic, let's see where it goes.

Day 23: October 5, 2020

Some more reading code and experimenting with things to see what happens.

Day 24: October 6, 2020

Some more reading code and experimenting with things to see what happens.

Day 25: October 7, 2020

Went through over 300 lines of code today, easily my best. Project starting to make sense as to how it works, though some doubts remain. 

Day 26: October 8, 2020

Didn't go through as much code as yesterday, but still learned quite a few things such as clearing screen for different OSs, the concept of pickling, and got a refresher on things I'd forgotten like handling files. 

Day 27: October 9, 2020

Another day of going through code. Thinking of taking a break from this project and resuming/starting my own so I get back to writing code.

Day 28: October 10, 2020

Started learning some Flask. For now, the plan is to try out some different things and see if anything piques my interest, will go on from there.

Day 29: October 11, 2020

Some more Flask from tutorial.
